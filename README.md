NOTE: Unlike master, the branch has had some work done since the challenge ended.

Heroku Instructions:
  Just link the github repo to Heroku through master branch AND make sure to set the env variable NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION to false !! This is hacky as hell but it lets Heroku bundle the app with webpack (and also will keep it from erroring out when using Volleyball on the server (Volleyball is a devdependency))

Basic structure of the app:
  There are just some titles and a map of the field with bots and nodes
  The map is generated by making a set of rows, each of which is composed of cells. The row components are quite dumb; they just pass an object containing the bots and nodes to the cells. The cells are smarter; they identify if they have a bot, node, or both in them, and change their display accordingly. They also display scores/current values of bots/nodes. The map component makes the API calls once per second to get constantly updating data.

  The stucture in which the bots and nodes are stored on the state was picked for fast lookup times so each row/cell didn't have to filter through arrays of bots and nodes over and over. I actually blew quite a bit of time designing this because I wanted to avoid the performance hit, even though with a 20x20 grid it wouldn't really have mattered.

Things I wish I could have added:
  A way to only view subsections of the map
  A way to filter bots and nodes by value
  A way to click on a node/bot and get a display of its status put on the screen
  A way to click on a node/bot and get a constantly updating display of its current status put on the screen
